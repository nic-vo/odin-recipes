			<h2>About this recipe</h2>
			<p>
				Pho, a beloved Vietnamese noodle soup, boasts a rich history
				deeply intertwined with Vietnam's cultural heritage.
				Its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century,
				emerging in the northern regions of Vietnam.
				Influenced by French colonialism, pho's evolution began with
				the introduction of beef into Vietnamese cuisine.
				The dish gradually gained popularity as street vendors
				and local eateries perfected their own unique variations,
				blending indigenous flavors with foreign influences.
				Initially served as a breakfast staple, pho soon became
				a beloved national dish, symbolizing Vietnam's culinary prowess
				and resilience in the face of adversity.
			</p>
			<p>
				In modern times, pho has transcended its traditional roots to become
				a global culinary sensation, inspiring chefs around the world to put
				their own innovative twists on the classic dish.
				From vegan and vegetarian renditions to fusion interpretations
				that incorporate diverse ingredients and culinary techniques,
				modern takes on pho showcase its versatility and adaptability.
				In cosmopolitan cities like Los Angeles, Melbourne, and London,
				food enthusiasts can indulge in creative interpretations of pho,
				featuring unconventional toppings, artisanal broths,
				and inventive presentations. Despite these contemporary adaptations,
				the essence of pho—its comforting broth, delicate rice noodles,
				and fragrant herbs—remains at the heart of every bowl,
				serving as a testament to the enduring legacy
				of this beloved Vietnamese comfort food.
