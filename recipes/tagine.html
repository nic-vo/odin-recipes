			<h2>About this recipe</h2>
			<p>
				Chicken tagine is a dish deeply rooted in Moroccan culinary heritage,
				with a history dating back centuries. The tagine itself refers to
				both the cooking vessel and the flavorful stew prepared within it.
				Traditionally, tagines were cooked over coals or low flames,
				allowing the ingredients to simmer slowly and develop
				rich, complex flavors. The dish likely originated in North Africa,
				where it served as a practical solution for cooking meats
				and vegetables in a region with limited water resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over time, chicken tagine evolved to incorporate a diverse array
				of ingredients, reflecting the cultural sway of the Mediterranean,
				Middle East, and beyond. The dish typically features
				tender pieces of chicken, seasoned with aromatic spices such as
				saffron, cumin, and cinnamon. Alongside the chicken,
				a colorful medley of vegetables like carrots, potatoes, and olives
				adds both texture and depth to the stew. With its fragrant aroma
				and comforting taste, chicken tagine remains a beloved staple
				in Moroccan cuisine, cherished for its ability to
				bring people together around the communal dining table.
